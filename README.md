# Recipe Puppy

React-Native application written in Expo.io.

## Three main files

RecipeSearch.js - To call the recipepuppy API.  I've used async and await to make calling of the API more straightforward.  
This search functionality is in a seperate file to enable further testing.

SearchComponent.js - To handle the user entering query criteria.  
This component does one thing and making it easy to test.

ResultsComponents.js - To show the results.  
This component does one thing and making it easy to test.

## Expo.io
